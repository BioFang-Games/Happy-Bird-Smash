# Happy Bird Smash

Happy Bird Smash game for Windows, Linux, MacOS, and Android OS. (Source Code)

Happy Bird Smash is a simple Indie Game by BioFang Games. It is not intended to be distributed publicly, but in a private setting. Distribution may only occur if done by BioFang Games or a platform's respective app store, not an outside source. This is a work-in-progress and some files will be linked across the web for help with code errors and such. Any outside source will not have, nor will ever have, permission to use these files for their own purposes.

Please Note:
If a public version were to ever be released, without a definitive guaruntee that there will, it will happen on public channels, like the Steam Store, Apple App Store, etc., not on typical internet browsers. If you see our game made public on any store or webpage other than on the official channels bearing the BioFang Games name, please report them to the Sole Proprietor of BioFang Games, "NotNot" Justin Young, at the email nnjofficial(at)outlook(dot)com . Second, the game will remain free forever. If you see this game bearing a price please report it to that very same email address.


# How to play Happy Bird Smash

Happy Bird Smash can be compared to (arguably) the greatest mobile game in history, Angry Birds. This game allows you to tap or click on a little green bird and drag your finger or mouse across the screen to build up momentum. Release to launch the bird at the Monsters standing in the play area. Be careful with your aim, though, as you only get one chance to knock down and destroy all the Monsters. This game currently only has one working level and, as stated in the section above, is a work-in-progress.

## Goal of this project

The goal of the Happy Bird Smash project is a simple one; it's a way for Justin to learn how to use Unity and Unity C#. It's also a tool used to provide fun for his little brother and little sister.
